# fp_with_haskell
Learning pure functional programming by defining functions in Haskell. 

Functional programming has multiple benefits, including: 
1) Avoids most of the difficulties associated with parallel programming.
2) User-friendly and computationally cheap.
3) Programs easily understood â€“ Correctness can be mathematically proven.
4) Software makes full use of underlying parallel processing hardware.
